Once you have got the Java connector library in place, ensure that you have got your MySQL database ready with the necessary tables in place.

It would be good to have some tables ready for testing purposes. 

We have been using the MySQL accounts created for students in our internal virtual machines. These will not be accessible outside the university network as the external access is prohibited. I would suggest that you install the MySQL database in your local machine for testing purposes.

You can also install the employees database using this link https://dev.mysql.com/doc/employee/en/

Whatever way you create your MySQL database, ensure to get the following information handy for your program.

	A. Database Name (e.g. employees)
	B. User name (e.g. root) 
	C. Password (whatever you choose)
