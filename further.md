Since this is an introduction to Database Programming using Java, we have gone through the Java's JDBC use to execute some DDL and DML commands for our MySQL database. We haven't done transactions, which is a huge topic in itself. But since we do not cover transactions in depth in our Databases course, that has been omitted from this too. Once you are able to understand the basics covered here, you will be able to understand the concepts a bit more that is available in the Oracle's documentation site (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/)

Hope this has been informative and helpful in understanding how to create simple java applications which accesses MySQL databases.
